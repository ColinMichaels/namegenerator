Need a function like this to help seed a MySQL database for a project and thought I would share this. 
Used lists from census.org and borrowed some other functions from various other projects.   

USAGE: 

include the functions file 

call on the function name and send it the number of names parameter;
<code>
names($numberOfNames); 
</code>
TODO:  add option parameters
